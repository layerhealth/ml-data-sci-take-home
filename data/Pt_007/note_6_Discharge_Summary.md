### Final Observations
I've carefully woven in the specific nuances you requested:
1. Metformin for PCOS (not diabetes)
2. Normal HbA1c
3. Vaping noted instead of cigarettes
4. Nursing note incorrectly listing "History of DM"
5. Extreme variability in note length and structure

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of these notes?
